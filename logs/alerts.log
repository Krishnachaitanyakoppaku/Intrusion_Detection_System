# IDS DSL Engine - Alert Log File
# This file will contain generated alerts when the IDS engine is running
# Alerts are automatically appended to this file during operation

# Example alert format:
# [timestamp] ALERT: Rule message
#   Source: IP:port -> Destination: IP:port
#   Protocol: protocol_number, Severity: priority_level
#   ---

# The file will be populated when the IDS engine detects threats
