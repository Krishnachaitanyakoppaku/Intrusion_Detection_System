# Sample Packet Capture File
# This file contains sample network traffic for testing the IDS engine
# Note: This is a placeholder file. In a real implementation, this would be
# a binary .pcap file created with tools like tcpdump or Wireshark.

# To create a real .pcap file for testing:
# 1. Use tcpdump to capture traffic:
#    sudo tcpdump -i any -w test_data/sql_injection.pcap
# 2. Generate test traffic:
#    curl "http://localhost/index.php?id=1' OR 1=1--"
#    curl "http://localhost/search.php?q=<script>alert('xss')</script>"
# 3. Stop tcpdump with Ctrl+C

# Example tcpdump commands for creating test data:
# sudo tcpdump -i lo -w test_data/localhost_traffic.pcap
# sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w test_data/ethernet_traffic.pcap
# sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -w test_data/wireless_traffic.pcap

# The .pcap file should contain:
# - HTTP requests with SQL injection attempts
# - HTTP requests with XSS payloads
# - SSH connection attempts
# - ICMP ping packets
# - Various TCP and UDP traffic

# For testing purposes, you can use these commands to generate traffic:
# ping -c 10 8.8.8.8
# curl -s http://httpbin.org/get
# ssh -o ConnectTimeout=1 localhost
# telnet localhost 80
